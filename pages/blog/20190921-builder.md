# Creating a Script for Builder

The Builder repository contains the files that go into each new treehouses image.
When you modify a file here, once it's merged it will be part of the next update.

Below are detailed instructions on how to make an addition to Builder


Example situation:

You just downloaded the new update for treehouses and start it up.
You realize a lot of the software/items you had downloaded for testing purposes in the old image must be re-downloaded all over again.
You notice terraform, for example, takes a while to download and is something you keep needing to re-install.
Why not have terraform already installed in the image?

You can do that by adding a script to Builder.



## Step 0: Find the Right Download Link

1. Go to Terraform's [download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page
1. Scroll down and find the option for Linux (treehouses is based off of Raspbian, a Linux distribution)
1. Skip over 32-bit and 64-bit, and right click on "arm", the correct selection for RPi's
1. Select "copy link address", which should look like this: `https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.8/terraform_0.12.8_linux_arm.zip`


## Step 1: Write the Script for Installation
Just as you would install terraform on your own system, you will write a script with a list of the commands you would use and they will be executed on the treehouses system

Your script should include the following:

1. First you will use the `wget` command to retrieve the download: `wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.7/terraform_0.12.7_linux_arm.zip`
1. Next unzip your file using `unzip`: `unzip terraform_0.12.7_linux_arm.zip`
1. Now you will create a directory to place the terraform file in: `mkdir -p mnt/img_root/usr/local/bin/`
1. And move the downloaded and unzipped file inside using `mv`: `mv terraform mnt/img_root/usr/local/bin/.`
1. Before saving your script complete step 2

## Step 2: Include the File in the Correct Folder

1. Locate the builder Repo in treehouses
1. Open scripts.d and scroll to the bottom
1. You will see the last entry is 31_install_ssh_configs.sh so you will include your file after this one by calling it 32_terraform.sh
1. Now go ahead and save and name your script 32_terraform.sh
1. As usual you will have a new branch for your changes and make sure you are on this branch using `git checkout mybranch`
1. Include your script in the scripts.d folder and push your changes to your branch.

## Step 3: Compiling Builder



## Step 4: Testing your script
